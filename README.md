# Introduction

Hello, my name is Jacob Price and I am a recent graduate from Bridgerland Technical College. During my time in college, I worked on various team development projects that helped me to enhance my skills in web development.

In this portfolio, I would like to showcase my projects that I worked on during my team development program. Specifically, I would like to highlight my REST API project that I developed using Node.js, MongoDB, and integrating third-party APIs, as well as my resume project that uses Svelte, Tailwind, and C#.

# REST API Project

The REST API project was a collaborative effort where my team developed an API that would integrate with third-party APIs to pull data from different sources. We used Node.js and MongoDB to develop a robust API that would be able to handle multiple requests at once. Our API was able to authenticate users, retrieve data from different sources, and present that data in a user-friendly way. We also used various libraries and frameworks such as Express.js and Mongoose to make the development process faster and more efficient.

# Resume Project

The resume project was a solo project where I developed a website that showcased my resume in an interactive and user-friendly way. I used Svelte to create the frontend and C# for the backend. The website features a sleek and modern design that is easy to navigate. I also used Tailwind CSS to add custom styling to the website.

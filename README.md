# Introduction

Hello, my name is Jacob Price and I am a recent graduate from Bridgerland Technical College. During my time in college, I worked on various team development projects that helped me to enhance my skills in web development.

In this portfolio, I would like to showcase my projects that I worked on during my team development program. Specifically, I would like to highlight my REST API project that I developed using Node.js, MongoDB, and integrating third-party APIs, as well as my resume project that uses Svelte, Tailwind, and C#.

# REST API Project

The REST API project was a collaborative effort where my team developed an API that would integrate with third-party APIs to pull data from different sources. We used Node.js and MongoDB to develop a robust API that would be able to handle multiple requests at once. Our API was able to authenticate users, retrieve data from different sources, and present that data in a user-friendly way. We also used various libraries and frameworks such as Express.js and Mongoose to make the development process faster and more efficient.

# Resume Project

The resume project is an online business venture that I am working on, which uses C# for the backend and Tailwind and Svelte for the frontend. The project aims to simplify the process of building resumes by providing users with easy-to-use templates and tools to create custom resumes.

The website has a sleek and modern design that is easy to navigate, making it user-friendly. The main focus of the project is to simplify the resume process for users who may not have extensive knowledge of design or formatting. With our templates and easy-to-use tools, users can create professional-looking resumes quickly and easily.

Our project aims to be a one-stop-shop for all things resume-related, and we are constantly working to improve our services and offerings. We are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for our users and helping them to achieve their career goals.
